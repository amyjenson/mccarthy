\label{fig:glacier:bedstep}
\end{figure}

To start the presentation we state the Stokes model for 2D ice flow, with glacier-suitable boundary conditions, for example as in Figure \ref{fig:glacier:bedstep}.  The solver works for any reasonable ice geometry, for example with a bedrock step (rise) as shown.  However, because the slab-on-a-slope case has an exact solution, which is useful for understanding, verification purposes, and as a source of boundary conditions for other cases, we address that special case first.  We then derive the weak form of the Stokes problem and give a brief overview of finite element (FE) methods.  Our particular FE method uses an unstructured mesh of triangular or quadrilateral elements, optionally using an extruded mesh, to solve the Glen-Stokes problem by a stable ``mixed'' method with distinct approximating spaces for velocity and pressure.  Finally, we demonstrate numerical solutions and give a brief guide to usage.


\section{Glen-Stokes model} \label{sec:stokes}

Let us start from the Glen-Stokes model stated in the notes.  This model, also described in \cite{GreveBlatter2009,JouvetRappaz2011}, applies on any 2D or 3D domain $\Omega$ which has a piecewise smooth boundary.  Allowing any Glen exponent $n\ge 1$, the equations are:
\begin{align}
- \nabla \cdot \tau + \nabla p &= \rho \bg &&\text{\emph{stress balance}} \label{forcebalance} \\
\nabla \cdot \bu &= 0 &&\text{\emph{incompressibility}} \label{incompressible} \\
D\bu &= A_n |\tau|^{n-1} \tau &&\text{\emph{Glen flow law}} \label{flowlaw}
\end{align}
The notation here generally follows the notes, including velocity $\bu$, pressure $p$, ice density $\rho$, acceleration of gravity $\bg$, deviatoric stress tensor $\tau$, strain rate tensor $D\bu$, and ice softness $A_n$.  A key idea is that tensors $D\bu$ and $\tau$ are symmetric (conservation of angular momentum) and have trace zero (incompressibility).  Note that $D\bu$ is the symmetric part of the tensor velocity derivative $\grad \bu$:
\begin{equation}
(D\bu)_{ij} = \frac{1}{2} \left(\grad\bu + \grad\bu^\top\right) = \frac{1}{2} \left((u_i)_{x_j} + (u_j)_{x_i}\right) \label{strainrate}
\end{equation}
The full (Cauchy) stress tensor $\sigma$ is the deviatoric stress tensor $\tau$ minus the pressure,
\begin{equation}
    \sigma = \tau - p\,I,  \label{cauchystress}
\end{equation}
so equation \eqref{forcebalance} simply says $-\Div \sigma = \rho \bg$.  One may derive from \eqref{cauchystress} that $p = -\frac{1}{2} \trace(\sigma)$, in 2D anyway, thus the pressure is the negative of the average normal stress.  By definition $\Div\tau$ in \eqref{forcebalance} is a vector with components which are the divergences of the columns:
\begin{equation}
    \left(\nabla \cdot \tau\right)_i = \left(\tau_{1i}\right)_{x_1} + \left(\tau_{2i}\right)_{x_2}  \label{divtaudefn}
\end{equation}
Note $\nabla\cdot \tau$, $\nabla p$, and $\bg$ are regarded as column vectors.

The viscosity form of \eqref{flowlaw} can also be found in the notes:
\begin{equation}
\tau = 2\nu D\bu = B_n |D\bu|^{\frac{1}{n} - 1} D\bu  \label{viscflowlaw}
\end{equation}
Here $B_n = (A_n)^{-1/n}$ is the ice hardness in units $\text{Pa}\,\text{s}^{1/n}$.  The tensor norm notation used in \eqref{flowlaw}  and \eqref{viscflowlaw} is defined as follows, with the summation convention:
\begin{align*}
|\tau|^2 = \frac{1}{2} \trace\left(\tau^2\right) = \frac{1}{2} \tau_{ij} \tau_{ij}, \qquad |D\bu|^2 = \frac{1}{2} \trace\left((D\bu)^2\right) = \frac{1}{2} (D\bu)_{ij} (D\bu)_{ij}
\end{align*}

Using \eqref{viscflowlaw} we can eliminate $\tau$ from equation \eqref{forcebalance}, thereby rewriting the system in terms of velocity $\bu$ and pressure $p$ only:
\begin{align}
- \nabla \cdot \left(B_n |D\bu|^{\frac{1}{n} - 1} D\bu\right) + \nabla p &= \rho \mathbf{g} \label{stokes} \\
\Div \bu &= 0 \label{incompagain}
\end{align}
Also, from now on we denote the points of the 2D region $\Omega$ by $(x,z)$, and we add an angle parameter: gravity is at an angle $\alpha$ with the $z$-direction, so that $\bg = \left<g\sin\alpha,-g\cos\alpha\right>$ where $g>0$.  The numerical model in these notes solves system \eqref{stokes}, \eqref{incompagain} with a body force given by this $\rho \bg$.  A solution of the problem is a pair $(\bu,p)$.

Certain glacier-suitable velocity and stress boundary conditions will be used here.  We assume that base, top, inflow, and outflow boundaries can all be identified.  On the base we require no slip:
\begin{align}
\bu &= 0  &&\text{\emph{base}} \label{basebc} \\
\intertext{(although this can be modified if the user desires).  On the top we set a condition of zero applied stress, $\sigma\hbn=0$:}
\left(B_n |D\bu|^{\frac{1}{n} - 1} D\bu - pI\right) \hbn &= 0  &&\text{\emph{top}} \label{topbc} \\
\intertext{The inflow boundary is the left side, which has outward normal $\hbn=\left<-1,0\right>$, and here we set a nonzero inflow velocity:}
\bu &= \left<f(z),0\right>  &&\text{\emph{inflow}} \label{inflowbc} \\
\intertext{The implemented function $f(z)$ satisfies the slab-on-slope equations for a given thickness $H_{\text{in}}$; see below.  On an outflow boundary, which is the right side and has $\hbn=\left<1,0\right>$ in the implemented form, we set a nonzero hydrostatic normal stress using the ice thickness $H_{\text{out}}$ at that location:}
\left(B_n |D\bu|^{\frac{1}{n} - 1} D\bu - pI\right) \hbn &= C_{\text{out}} \big<- \rho g \cos\alpha (H_{\text{out}}-z),  \notag && \\
    &\qquad\qquad \rho g\sin\alpha (H_{\text{out}}-z)\big> && \text{\emph{outflow}} \label{outflowbc}
\end{align}
The implemented constant $C_{\text{out}} $ is set so that the applied stress on the outflow equals what the applied stress on the inflow would be, thus $C_{\text{out}} = (H_{\text{in}}/H_{\text{out}})^2$.


\section{Slab-on-slope solutions}  \label{sec:slab}

Testing a numerical model requires verification tools, namely exact solutions.  Such solutions are in short supply for the Glen-Stokes model, so now we recapitulate the slab-on-slope construction given in the notes, allowing any Glen exponent $n$.  This also generates inflow and outflow boundary conditions which can be used for more general flows.

Using component notation for 2D, equations \eqref{stokes}, \eqref{incompagain} become the following Glen-Stokes model in coordinates $(x,z)$ and velocity components $\bu=\left<u,w\right>$:
\begin{align}
- \left(B_n |D\bu|^{\frac{1}{n}-1} u_x\right)_x - \left(\frac{1}{2} B_n |D\bu|^{\frac{1}{n}-1} \left(u_z+w_x\right)\right)_z + p_x &= \rho g\sin\alpha \label{planestressx} \\
- \left(\frac{1}{2} B_n |D\bu|^{\frac{1}{n}-1} \left(u_z+w_x\right)\right)_x - \left(B_n |D\bu|^{\frac{1}{n}-1} w_z\right)_z + p_z &= -\rho g\cos\alpha \label{planestressz} \\
u_x + w_z &= 0 \label{planeincomp}
\end{align}
The strain-rate norm expands to
\begin{equation}
    |D\bu|^2 = \frac{1}{2} \left(u_x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(u_z+w_x)^2 + w_z^2\right)  \label{planeDnorm}
\end{equation}

Consider either an infinitely-long or a periodic slab flow.  It has fixed ($x$-independent) values of the bed elevation $b$ and the surface elevation $h$, so the domain is $\Omega = \{(x,z)\,|\,b < z < h\}$.  Assume that the boundary stresses are also $x$-independent.  Then there is no variation in $x$, i.e.~$\partial/\partial x=0$, so the system simplifies:
\begin{align}
- \left(\frac{1}{2}B_n |D\bu|^{\frac{1}{n}-1} u_z\right)_z &= \rho g\sin\alpha \label{slabstresses} \\
p_z &= -\rho g\cos\alpha \notag \\
w_z &= 0 \notag
\end{align}
Also, the strain-rate norm simplifies to $|D\bu| = \frac{1}{2} |u_z|$.  If we further assume that there is no melt or freeze at the base then $w=0$ identically; the ice velocity is bed and surface parallel.  Then an integration with respect to $z$, and assumption of zero pressure at the surface, yields hydrostatic pressure:
\begin{equation}
p(z) = \rho g\cos\alpha (h-z)  \label{pslab}
\end{equation}

Now \eqref{slabstresses} yields a single nontrivial equation for the horizontal velocity:
    $$- \left(\frac{B_n}{2^{1/n}} |u_z|^{\frac{1}{n}-1} u_z\right)_z = \rho g\sin\alpha$$
As we expect $u_z>0$, rearrangement gives
    $$\left((u_z)^{1/n} \right)_z = - \frac{2^{1/n} \rho g\sin\alpha}{B_n}$$
This can be vertically-integrated downward from the surface $z=h$, using the no-stress condition, which simplifies to $u_z=0$, to give
\begin{equation}
u_z = 2 \left(\frac{\rho g\sin\alpha}{B_n}\right)^n (h-z)^n  \label{uzslab}
\end{equation}
Integrating vertically again, upward from the base $z=b$ where $u=0$, gives
\begin{equation}
u(z) = \frac{2}{n+1} \left(\frac{\rho g\sin\alpha}{B_n}\right)^n \left((h-b)^{n+1} - (h-z)^{n+1}\right)  \label{uslab}
\end{equation}

Formulas \eqref{pslab} and \eqref{uslab} exactly solve the Stokes equations and the described boundary conditions.  They will be used for verifying the numerical solver.

Additionally these slab-on-slope formulas allow us to set boundary conditions which lead to glaciologically-reasonable solutions for more general shapes like that shown in Figure \ref{fig:glacier:bedstep}.  In the implemented cases, the inflow side has \eqref{uslab} applied as a Dirichlet condition, as in \eqref{inflowbc}.  On the outflow side we apply a normal stress derived from \eqref{uzslab}.  That is, using the facts that $w=0$, $u_x=0$, $|D\bu| = \frac{1}{2} u_z$, and $\hbn=\left<1,0\right>$, we have
\begin{align*}
\sigma \hbn &= \left(B_n |D\bu|^{\frac{1}{n}-1} D\bu - pI\right)\hbn = \left(B_n |D\bu|^{\frac{1}{n}-1} \begin{pmatrix} u_x & \frac{1}{2}(u_z+w_x) \\ \frac{1}{2}(u_z+w_x) & w_z \end{pmatrix} - pI\right)\hbn \\
    &= B_n \left(\frac{1}{2} u_z\right)^{\frac{1}{n}-1} \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ \frac{1}{2} u_z \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} p \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} - p \\ \frac{B_n}{2^{1/n}} (u_z)^{1/n} \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} - \rho g\cos\alpha (h-z) \\ \rho g\sin\alpha (h-z) \end{pmatrix}
\end{align*}
This justifies formula \eqref{outflowbc}.


\section{Weak form} \label{sec:weakform}

Equations \eqref{stokes} and \eqref{incompagain} are called the \emph{strong form} of the model.  An integral equation form of the same equations, the \emph{weak form}, is needed when building a numerical finite element (FE) method \cite{Elmanetal2014}.  This new form is derived by multiplying the strong form equations by test functions and then integrating over $\Omega$.  This defines a nonlinear functional $F$, that is, a function which takes functions as input and returns scalars.  The weak form says that $F$ is zero when acting on test functions.  The significance of the weak form can be stated in several ways:
\begin{itemize}
\item It is well-posed in the sense of always having a unique solution  for glaciologically-relevant boundary values \cite{JouvetRappaz2011}.
\item It has a larger space of potential solutions than the strong form, for instance it is more flexible with respect to discontinuities in the data.
\item An FE method can create test functions, via local constructions which work on a mesh of triangles or quadrilaterals, and these go into the weak form.  This framework is more flexible with respect to problem geometry than are, for example, finite difference methods based on the strong form.
\end{itemize}

A solution to the weak form stated below is a pair $(\bu,p)$ wherein each function lives in a certain function space.  We write $\bu\in V_D$ and $p \in Q$ here, but the Sobolev spaces $V_D$ and $Q$ are precisely-identified in \cite{JouvetRappaz2011}.  Test functions $\bv\in V_0$ and $q\in Q$ come from nearly the same spaces, with $V_D$ and $V_0$ differing only by the value on the Dirichlet boundary: $\bu\in V_D$ satisfies a nonhomogeneous inflow condition \eqref{inflowbc} while $\bv\in V_0$ is zero there.

To give an initial definition of $F$ we multiply \eqref{stokes} by $\bv\in V_0$ and \eqref{incompagain} by $q\in Q$, then add and integrate:
\begin{equation}
F(\bu,p;\bv,q) = \int_\Omega - \left(\nabla \cdot \left(B_n |D\bu|^{\frac{1}{n} - 1} D\bu\right)\right)\cdot \bv + \nabla p \cdot \bv - \rho \mathbf{g} \cdot \bv - \left(\nabla \cdot \bu\right) q \label{nonfuncone}
\end{equation}
However, the desired definition of $F$ balances the number of derivatives on $(\bv,q)$ versus $(\bu,p)$, that is, it has only first derivatives on $\bu,\bv$, and no derivative on $p,q$.  To make this change we need integration-by-parts.

Recall the product rule $\nabla \cdot(f\bX) = \grad f\cdot \bX + f \nabla \cdot \bX$ and the divergence theorem $\int_\Omega \nabla \cdot (f\bX) = \int_{\partial \Omega} f\bX \cdot \hbn$.  Denoting $\tau = B_n |D\bu|^{\frac{1}{n} - 1} D\bu$ for convenience we have
\begin{align*}
\int_\Omega \left(\nabla \cdot \tau\right)\cdot \bv &= \sum_{j=1}^2 \int_\Omega \nabla \cdot (\tau_{j\circ})\, v_j = \sum_{j=1}^2 \int_\Omega \nabla \cdot (\tau_{j\circ} v_j) - \tau_{j\circ} \nabla v_j \\
  &= \sum_{j=1}^2 \int_{\partial \Omega} (\tau_{j\circ} v_j) \cdot \hbn - \int_\Omega \tau_{j\circ} \cdot \nabla v_j = \int_{\partial \Omega} (\tau \hbn)\cdot \bv - \int_\Omega \trace(\tau \nabla \bv)
\end{align*}
where $\circ$ denotes a vector entry index and $\tau_{j\circ}$ denotes the $j$th row of $\tau$.  Here $\grad\bv$ defines a $2\times 2$ matrix,
\newcommand{\treftwo}[2]{\left[\begin{array}{c|c} & \\ #1 & #2 \\ & \end{array}\right]}
\newcommand{\trefthree}[3]{\left[\begin{array}{c|c|c} & & \\ #1 & #2 & #3 \\ & & \end{array}\right]}
    $$\grad \bv = \treftwo{\grad v_1}{\grad v_2} = \begin{bmatrix}
    (v_1)_{x_1} & (v_2)_{x_1} \\
    (v_1)_{x_2} & (v_2)_{x_2}
    \end{bmatrix}$$
and so
    $$\trace(\tau \grad \bv) = \sum_{j=1}^3 \tau_{j\circ} \cdot \grad v_j = \sum_{i,j=1}^3 \tau_{ji} (v_j)_{x_i}$$
(Some sources write $A:B$ for $\trace(AB)$ \cite{JouvetRappaz2011}.)  Note $\trace(\tau \grad \bv) = \trace(\tau D\bv)$ because $\trace(AB)=0$ if $A$ is symmetric and $B$ is antisymmetric.  (To show this take $A=\tau$ and $B=\grad\bv-D\bv$.)  Finally we do a straightforward integration-by-parts on the pressure part of $F$:
    $$\int_\Omega \nabla p \cdot \bv = \int_\Omega \nabla\cdot (p\,\bv) - p (\nabla \cdot \bv) = \int_{\partial \Omega} p\hbn \cdot \bv - \int_\Omega p (\nabla \cdot \bv)$$

The above facts allow us to rewrite \eqref{nonfuncone} with a normal stress boundary integral:
\begin{equation}
F(\bu,p;\bv,q) =  \int_\Omega \left[\trace(\tau D\bv) - p (\nabla \cdot \bv) - \left(\nabla \cdot \bu\right) q - \rho \mathbf{g} \cdot \bv\right] - \int_{\partial\Omega} (\sigma \hbn)\cdot \bv \label{nonfunctwo}
\end{equation}
(We have denoted $\sigma=\tau-pI$ for brevity.)  Note $\bu,\bv$ appear with first derivatives and $p,q$ have no derivatives.

Next recall that $\bv\in V_0$ satisfies $\bv=0$ along the base and inflow surfaces.  Thus these parts of the integral over $\partial\Omega$ in \eqref{nonfunctwo} are zero.  Conditions \eqref{topbc}, \eqref{outflowbc} now completely eliminate the unknown solution $\bu,p$ from the boundary integral.  The above computations yield our final formula for the nonlinear functional:
\begin{align}
F(\bu,p;\bv,q) &= \int_\Omega B_n |D\bu|^{\frac{1}{n} - 1} \trace(D\bu D\bv) - p (\nabla \cdot \bv) - \left(\nabla \cdot \bu\right) q \label{defineF} \\
    &\qquad  - \int_\Omega \rho \mathbf{g} \cdot \bv - \int_{\{\text{outflow}\}} C_{\text{out}} \rho g \cos\alpha (h-z) v  \notag
\end{align}

The weak form of the Glen-Stokes model is the statement that, at the solution $\bu\in V_D$ and $p\in Q$, functional $F$ in \eqref{defineF} is zero in all test function directions:
\begin{equation}
F(\bu,p;\bv,q) = 0 \qquad \text{ for all } \bv\in V_0 \text{ and } q\in Q  \label{weak}
\end{equation}
This weak formulation is proven in \cite[Theorem 3.8]{JouvetRappaz2011} to be well-posed, so that a unique solution exists.  The well-posedness theorem makes reasonable assumptions about the domain $\Omega$ and the boundary data, and these are satisfied in the cases we consider.  Noting that the last two integrals in \eqref{defineF} can be regarded as source terms for stress, if the inflow velocity is zero and if we replace the source terms by zero---we remove gravity and outflow stresses---then the unique solution to \eqref{weak} is $\bu=0$ and $p=0$.

Now our goal is to accurately approximate the solution $(\bu,p)$ of \eqref{weak} using an FE method.


\section{Finite element method} \label{sec:femethod}

FIXME FROM HERE This section gives a very abbreviated summary of our method to solve the Stokes equations.  Better coverage of FE methods is in the references \cite{Braess2007,Bueler2021,Elmanetal2014}.  The method here is actually applied through calls to Firedrake \cite{Rathgeberetal2016}, so we do not implement most of the following techniques ourselves.

The fundamental FE idea is to replace the infinite-dimensional function spaces appearing in the weak form \eqref{weak} with finite-dimensional subspaces constructed locally from triangles in the mesh.  The approximate solution $(\bu,p)$ is sought from these subspaces, and functional $F$ in \eqref{defineF} is computed on test functions $(\bv,q)$ from these subspaces.

Requiring $F$ to be zero over a basis of the subspaces defines the nonlinear \emph{discrete Glen-Stokes equations}.  We solve this nonlinear system of algebraic equations by Newton's method, with preconditioned Krylov iterations to solve the linear equations at each Newton step, using the PETSc solver library \cite{Balayetal2018,Bueler2021} living underneath Firedrake.

The triangular mesh $\mathcal{T}_h$ is stored in a \texttt{.msh} file generated by Gmsh; see section \ref{sec:implementation} below.  The triangulation $\mathcal{T}_h$ covers the domain $\Omega$ by a finite set of $K$ non-overlapping open triangles $\triangle_k$.  The subscript ``$h$'' denotes the maximum diameter of the triangles.  The $N_1$ vertices of the triangles are the nodes of the mesh, including nodes on $\partial\Omega$.  The nodes are located at coordinates $(x_i,z_i)$.

For a triangle $\triangle_k$ there are various choices of a \emph{finite element space}, a space of low-degree polynomials defined on that triangle.  By default we use two particular FE spaces, denoted $P_1$ for the pressure and $(P_2)^2$ for velocity.  (Other choices can be made at run-time.)  Using such paired spaces is called a \emph{mixed method}; the particular choice here is called $P_2$-$P_1$ or the lowest-order \emph{Taylor-Hood} elements \cite{Elmanetal2014}.

Consider just one triangle.  The name $P_1$ refers to the space of linear functions $a + b x + c z$ on the triangle.  Instead of using three degrees of freedom $\{a,b,c\}$ to describe such a function, the three vertices of the triangle are the preferred degrees of freedom (Figure \ref{fig:fedofs}).  That is, any $P_1$ function on the triangle is determined by its values at the vertices.  The $P_2$ space, used for the scalar components of velocity, is the space of quadratic functions $a + bx + cy + dx^2 + exy + fy^2$, with preferred six degrees of freedom at the vertices and edge midpoints \cite{Elmanetal2014}.

A continuous function on $\Omega$ which is piecewise-linear on each triangle, i.e.~in $P_1$ on each triangle, is determined by its values at the $N_1$ nodes.  The space of such functions is a subspace $Q^h \subset Q$ of the pressure function space $Q$ used in the weak form \eqref{weak}; we say $Q^h$ is a $P_1$ space.

A continuous function on $\Omega$ which is piecewise-quadratic on each triangle, i.e.~in $P_2$ (Figure \ref{fig:fedofs}), is determined by its values at the nodes plus the edge midpoints \cite{Elmanetal2014}.  Let $N_2$ denote the number of all such nodes at which the solution is sought.  (The meshes used in numerical examples have Dirichlet boundaries, and these nodes are not included in $N_2$.)  A small example of this kind of mesh is shown in Figure \ref{fig:fedims}.

We define $V_0^h$ to be the space of \emph{pairs} of scalar piecewise-quadratic functions on $\Omega$, additionally requiring them to be zero on the base and inflow boundaries, i.e.~where \eqref{basebc} and \eqref{inflowbc} apply.  Thus functions from $V_0^h$ are 2D vector fields whose components are piecewise-quadratic scalar functions, i.e.~$P_2$ functions.  We define $V_D^h$ to be the nearly the same space except satisfying \eqref{inflowbc} on the inflow boundary.  Thus we have two $P_2$ velocity subspaces used in the weak form \eqref{weak}: $V_0^h \subset V_0$, $V_D^h \subset V_D$.

``Hat'' functions $\psi_j(x,z)$ form a convenient pressure test function basis (of $Q^h$).  Such functions are linear on each triangle, continuous on $\Omega$, equal to one at the one node $(x_j,z_j)$, and otherwise zero at the nodes, so that $\psi_j(x_i,z_i) = \delta_{ij}$.  (Figure 1.6 in \cite{Elmanetal2014} shows such a hat function.)  The set $\{\psi_j\}$ is a set of $N_1$ linearly-independent functions in $Q^h$.  Similarly, for every $P_2$ node which is not in the base or inflow boundary, whether a triangle vertex or edge midpoint, one defines a pair of basis functions for the velocity test space $V_0^h$.  These are pairs of piecewise-quadratic hat functions, $(\phi_j(x,z),0)$ or $(0,\phi_j(x,z))$; Figure 1.7 in \cite{Elmanetal2014} suggests how such $P_2$ hat functions would look.  These hat functions form a set of $2N_2$ linearly-independent functions in $V_0^h$.

Using $P_2$-$P_1$ elements the dimension of the velocity space is always higher than the pressure space, and often much higher.  For example, for the $N_1=356$ vertex mesh shown in Figure \ref{fig:glacier}, the velocity dimension $2N_2=2646$ is seven times greater than $N_1$.  Such a dimension imbalance turns out to be desirable!  As explained in the FE literature under the obscure name ``inf-sup condition'' \cite{Braess2007,Bueler2021,Elmanetal2014}, Stokes equations mixed methods are only stable if the velocity space is sufficiently-large relative to the pressure space.

The FE method itself, a finite-dimensional approximation of the weak form \eqref{weak}, can now be stated.  It seeks $\bu^h \in V_D^h$ and $p^h \in Q^h$ so that
\begin{equation}
F(\bu^h,p^h;\bv^h,q^h) = 0 \qquad \text{ for all } \bv^h\in V_0^h \text{ and } q^h\in Q^h  \label{feweak}
\end{equation}
Note that we have merely added ``$h$'' superscripts to all continuum quantities!  The nonlinear functional $F$ is unchanged, and it is computed concretely, though also approximately, by quadrature \cite{Bueler2021,Elmanetal2014}.  The FEM solution to \eqref{feweak} can be shown to be well-posed by the same theory that applies to the continuum problem \cite[Theorem 4.3]{JouvetRappaz2011}.  By linearity of $F$ in the $\bv,q$ positions, it suffices to consider only a basis of test functions from $V_0^h$ and $Q^h$.  A system of nonlinear, algebraic equations, the (sparse) discrete Glen-Stokes problem, is thus formed by requiring \eqref{feweak} to hold for all basis functions identified above.  These equations are assembled element-by-element in the sense that for each triangle $\triangle_k$ the contribution from that triangle is added to the correct equation \cite[Chapter 10]{Bueler2021}.

Nonlinear system \eqref{feweak} is solved by Newton's method \cite{Bueler2021,Kelley2003}.  At each Newton step we solve a sparse and indefinite linear system.  These systems have a well-known block structure (Figure \ref{fig:lowspy}), so we apply a Schur complement preconditioner in the GMRES Krylov iteration \cite{Elmanetal2014,GolubVanLoan2013}.  This buzzword salad is an indication of the complexity of solver technology, and we abandon further explanation here, but see \cite[Chapter 14]{Bueler2021}.

Our Python codes define the nonlinear residual function $F$ in \eqref{defineF} using the Firedrake/FEniCs domain-specific language for describing such weak forms \cite{Alnaesetal2014}.  Then we call the Firedrake method \texttt{solve()} on \eqref{feweak} \cite{Rathgeberetal2016}.  A practical view of our codes, including the sequence in which they are used in practice, and how they are divided into modules, is in the final section of these notes.


\section{Implementation in Python} \label{sec:implementation}

We implement the above numerical solution method in Python using the Firedrake FE \cite{Rathgeberetal2016}.  The PETSc solver library \cite{Balayetal2018,Bueler2021} is called by Firedrake on the FE discretized nonlinear equations.

Here is a simple example solving the default Stokes problem:

\medskip
\begin{Verbatim}
$ ./domain.py -o glacier.geo                   # create domain outline
$ gmsh -2 glacier.geo                          # mesh domain
$ source ~/firedrake/bin/activate              # start Firedrake
(firedrake) $ ./flow.py -mesh glacier.msh      # solve Stokes problem
(firedrake) $ paraview glacier.pvd             # visualize results
\end{Verbatim}
%$

\medskip
\noindent The \verb|README.md| file documents usage and regression testing more thoroughly.

\medskip
As shown in Figure \ref{fig:blockdiagram} there are three major Python components:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{domain.py}: \quad  This writes an outline of the domain $\Omega$ into an ASCII file (\texttt{.geo} extension) using the Gmsh \cite{GeuzaineRemacle2009} geometry description language.  Note Gmsh can be used to examine and mesh this domain interactively, or at the command-line as above.  Portions of the boundary are marked with integer tags; see the Python dictionary \texttt{bdryids}.

\item \texttt{momentummodel.py}: \quad  Implements \texttt{class MomentumModel}.  Most actual ice physics is isolated here, including physical constants and the Stokes problem weak form \eqref{defineF}.  The \texttt{solve()} method assembles and solves the nonlinear Glen-Stokes problem \eqref{weak} using Firedrake's \texttt{solve()} command.  This solver has option prefix \texttt{s\_}.

\item \texttt{flow.py}: \quad  This driver reads user options, loads the mesh from a Gmsh \texttt{.msh} file, uses a \texttt{MomentumModel} object to solve the Stokes problem, and writes the solution into a Paraview-readable \texttt{.pvd} file.
\end{itemize}
