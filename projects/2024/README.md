# projects/2024/

These are notes and data and codes for my two suggested projects for the McCarthy International Summer School in Glaciology in 2024.  See `README.md` in the subdirectories `cliffdamage/` (Project 10) and `wavedrag/` (Project 11) for documentation.  These projects appear in the [projects list](https://glaciers.gi.alaska.edu/content/student-projects-0) for the Summer School.
